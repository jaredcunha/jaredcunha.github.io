<p class="intro">I'm going to give this page a makeover. It's not the shrine to myself that I deserve!</p>

<p>HELLO EVERYONE!!! I'm web designer living in Washington, D.C. Specifically, in the wonderful neighborhood of Logan Circle. I've spent the majority of my career deep in the bowels of <a href="http://politico.com">POLITICO</a>, fighting the good fight as the web design team lead. My duties consist of equal parts design and front-end development. Everyone once and while, I like to sneak into the newsroom to snag a slice of pizza that isn't mine.</p>

<h2>Here are some interesting things about me</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I enjoy cooking and eating, perhaps too much. But it doesn't show. People hate that.</li>
	<li>I'll gladly attempt a triathlon if it didn't involve swimming in disease-infested urban waterways</li>
	<li>I can kick my own head</li>
	<li>I'm learning how to speak Portuguese</li>
	<li>Amongst my friends, my name is synonymous with bacon</li>
</ul>
