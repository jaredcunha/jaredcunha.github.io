I am not tracking you on my site. I am not using cookies, third party scripts, or any other service that collects your data.

There was a time when I used Google Analytics, but why? Sure, it was interesting to see what posts were popular or where and how visitors were coming into my site. But did I ever take any actions based on that information? No, and I’m not sure I ever would. After some consideration, the need to periodically check my stats felt much less compelling.

**My curiosity is not worth your privacy.**

Credit goes to [Laura Kalbag](https://laurakalbag.com/i-dont-track-you/) for this idea. If it weren’t for her, I would have mindlessly placed another tracking script tag instead of thinking a little more deeply about it.
