I’ve noticed a recent trend on a few designers’ personal sites where most of the work is being done out in the open. In the beginning, a site will appear mostly unstyled or somewhat broken. Over time, you will see increasing levels of fidelity until a finalized product takes shape.

Some examples of this are [Rob Weychert](https://v7.robweychert.com/) and [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2019/redesign/). I have decided to take a similar approach. Some of goals for this year include redeveloping my site and publishing content more often. I haven’t written anything here since 2016.

This will be more than a redesign. I’ve been wanting to rearchitect the entire thing, moving from Jekyll to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), updating the build and deployment process, and so on.

I will post updates here to document notable updates as I move forward.
