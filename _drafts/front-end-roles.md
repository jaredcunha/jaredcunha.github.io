excerpt: "Some thoughts the role of a front end developer"
---
<div class="body-copy wrap" markdown="1">
The job description for a front-end developer often appears as defining someone who is responsible for implementing a visual design for use on the web. A quick google search for “front-end manifesto” will yield hundreds of results, but I want to add my own thoughts in respect to how we should think about our work and the impact it has on design.

My colleague, Jason Garber, wrote an excellent post about how [https://sixtwothree.org/posts/front-end-development-is-user-experience-design](front-end development is user experience design). I highly recommend it, and I think both designers and developers take something home.

Our job

We have as much to contribute to the design. 

In a large organization, there will be other developers who might have to touch the front-end. 

What good is a design if it doesn't work? What good is a design if its intended purpose never sees the light of day? 

- strengthen design
- create a system
- guiding designers
